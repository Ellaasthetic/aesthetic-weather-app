# aesthetic-weather-app

I built this weather application website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

•	During the development of my weather app, I began by creating a wireframe using Invision. This allowed me to visualize and plan the layout and design of the app.

•	To build the structure of the weather app, I utilized HTML. I employed HTML properties such as the bootstrap grid system, form tag, classes, Ids, and footer to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly interface.

•	After establishing the HTML structure, I proceeded to stylize the app using CSS. I applied various CSS properties such as margin, text-align, padding, border, font-size, color, text-shadow, and media queries to achieve a visually appealing and responsive design across different devices.

•	To add functionality to the weather app, I integrated JavaScript into the codebase. I implemented various functionalities such as displaying the current date, city name, temperature, weather descriptions. Icons representing weather conditions, and daily forecast predictions for the next six days. This was accomplished using JavaScript functions, the openweathermap API, axios for API requests, and DOM selectors for manipulating elements on the webpage.

•	By integrating all of these components together, I ensured that when a user searches for a specific city location, the weather app retrieves and displays relevant information including the temperature, weather description. Weather icon, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and daily forecast predictions.

•	Overall, the building process of my weather app involved meticulous planning, efficient utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integration of external APIs, and implementation of key functionalities to provide users with an intuitive and insightful weather experience.

•	Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges that further enhanced my problem-solving skills.
